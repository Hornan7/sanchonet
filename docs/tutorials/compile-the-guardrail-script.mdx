### How to compile the guardrail script from source

To compile the current version of the guardrail script yourself, you first have to clone the plutus repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus.git
cd plutus
```
Next we check out the version 1.31.0.0 of plutus and enter a nix development shell via
```bash
git checkout 1.31.0.0
nix develop
```
We then create a file `cabal.project.local` to override some dependencies as a hotfix (there is a circular dependency otherwise).
```cabal
cat <<EOF > cabal.project.local
allow-newer: *:plutus-ledger-api
allow-newer: *:prettyprinter-configurable
EOF
```
Next, we open in a text editor the file `cardano-constitution/cardano-constitution.cabal` and delete line 134 that reads `buildable:      False` via
```bash
sed -i '134d' cardano-constitution/cardano-constitution.cabal
```
Next, we can build the script via
```bash
cabal update
cabal run cardano-constitution:create-json-envelope -- guardrail.plutus
```
You can get the hash of this just compiled script via, for example
```bash
cardano-cli transaction policyid --script-file guardrail.plutus
```
And compare it to the one currently defined [here](https://book.world.dev.cardano.org/environments/mainnet/conway-genesis.json).
